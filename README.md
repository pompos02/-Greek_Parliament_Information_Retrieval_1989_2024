## Scope of the Project  

The project aims to create a robust system for analyzing and extracting insights from speeches in the Greek Parliament over the years 1989â€“2024. 

1. **Data Retrieval and Management**:  
   - Retrieval of raw speech data and storage in a structured PostgreSQL database.  
   - Merging and preprocessing speeches for efficient querying and analysis.  

2. **Search Engine**:  
   - Implementation of a full-text search engine with support for advanced querying.  
   - Utilizing a TF-IDF-based similarity measure to rank and retrieve relevant speeches.  
   - Providing a paginated interface to explore search results with details like MP names, speech summaries, and direct access to full speech text.  

3. **Keyword and Similarity Analysis**:  
   - Extracting top-K keywords for each speech, member of parliament, and political party.  
   - Tracking how keywords evolve over time to identify trends and shifts in focus.  
   - Calculating similarity scores between members to understand relationships and alignments.  

4. **Topic Modeling**:  
   - Using Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) to identify key themes in speeches and represent them in a reduced-dimensional space.  
   - Exploring alternative dimensionality reduction techniques like Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF).  

5. **Clustering**:  
   - Grouping speeches into clusters based on similarity to uncover patterns and thematic divisions.  

6. **Sentiment Analysis**:  
   - Evaluating the sentiment (polarity) of political party speeches and analyzing how it changes over time.  
   - Identifying the most positive and negative words associated with each political group.  

7. **Interactive Web Application**:  
   - Providing a user-friendly interface for searching, analyzing, and visualizing data.  
   - Enabling users to interact with various features such as keyword tracking, similarity analysis, and sentiment exploration.

## Setup Instructions  
To ensure the project functions correctly, follow these steps if you are running it for the first time:

1. Download the libraries listed in requirements.txt
2. Read the README file in the directory `Greek_Parliament_Information_Retrieval_1989_2024\pkl_files`. Download and place all `.pkl` files from the provided drive into the same directory.  
3. run the **nltk_download.py** script
4. Execute the following command in the terminal to download the necessary SpaCy model:  
   ```bash
   python -m spacy download el_core_news_sm
### Database  
PostgreSQL was used to store and manage data, hosted on Supabase. Data from the final CSV was stored in a table named `speeches`, while a `merged_speeches` table was created to consolidate speeches for each MP during a sitting.  

---

## Search Engine  
A search engine is implemented under the `/search_engine` route. Users can enter a query in a search bar, and the results are ranked using cosine similarity. Valid entries are presented with relevant details (e.g., MP's name, speech summary) in a paginated format.  

---

## Top K Keywords  
Extracts the top-K keywords for each speech, MP, and party. These keywords are analyzed to observe changes over time.  

---

## Top K Pairs by Similarity  
Using a TF-IDF matrix, cosine similarity is calculated between MPs to identify top-K pairs with the highest similarity scores.  

---

## Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI)  
The LSI model reduces dimensions of the TF-IDF matrix to identify thematic areas. Key terms per concept are displayed along the number of terms for each concept.  

---

## Speech Clustering  
Using LSI vectors, K-Means is applied to group speeches into clusters. Alternative dimensionality reduction methods like NMF are also evaluated for better results in  clustering.  

---

## Polarity Tracking by Parliament Group  
Sentiment analysis is performed to measure polarity scores for political parties over time. The frequency of the positive and negative keywords are stored and visualized.  

---

## Results  
All results are stored in the `results` folder, that also includes screenshots.
